# Mission

You can think of Missions as GameModes\(Battles/TeamDeathMatch\) etc. Missions are instantiated with a [Scene](../engine/scene.md), [MissionViews](https://github.com/Bannerlord-Modding/Documentation/tree/8e7de4e7aba5bbbc7f8fb951a66936248b8be454/_csharp-api/mountandblade/missionbehaviour/missionview.md), and [MissionBehaviours](missionbehaviour.md).

More information on missions will be available once we gain access to the `CampaignSystem` DLLs.

## Tips

* You can get the current mission instance \(if any\) by using `Mission.Current` property.
